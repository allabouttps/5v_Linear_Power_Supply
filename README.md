Linear 5V  Regulated Power Supply PCB design 
Description : This project is a simple 5V Linear Regulated Power Supply using the 7805 voltage regulator IC. 
The circuit takes 12V stepped down AC input and gives a constant 5V output.
Components Used:
- 7805 IC
- Capacitors
- LEDs
- Diodes
Aplications: Used in microcontroller based system-basically anywhere a clean 5V is needed without voltage fluctuation.
